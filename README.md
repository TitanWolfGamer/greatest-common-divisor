greatest common divisor
=======================

the function gcd in main.py contains a function called gcd!  
The only use of that function is to get the greatest common divisor of two numbers you pass in!  
For example:
143 and 481, pass them in and you get 13  
143 / 13 = 11  
481 / 13 = 37  

since at least one of them is prime, this is the greatest common divisor, 13
